My peer assessment for Coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data

Hi, this file will explain how my script works using the following steps:

Step 1: Read in the activity label file and assign it to a vector

Step 2: Read in the features file and assign it to a vector

Step 3: Read in the x train file and assign features as its column name

Step 4: Read in the y train file and assign activity label as its column name

Step 5: Read in the train subject file

Step 6: Combine x train, y train and tran subject into one table

Step 7: Repeat the above steps for test files

Step 8: Join test and train dataset into one dataset

Step 9: Filter columns to only include mean and std measures

Step 10: Reshape the data to pivot by subject and activity

Step 11: Create new table with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
